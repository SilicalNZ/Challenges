“#ttu-narrative is a story made up to entertain everyone...  It's a short and simple story revolving around TTU, however names will be taken from our Clan members to be put inside. Those names will only appear in the story if he/she can score high in TTU points or is ranked @Noble. I am looking forward for seeing your names appear as well.” - @Vyrtriv#7522



PROLOGUE

In the fantasy land of Tap Titan Universe, rise a group of elites born and destined to slain all the titans and cleanse the world of evil. Lead by the invincible Grandmaster BrainStormX with his prodigy Vice-Grandmaster SilicalNZ and 3 Chosen Moderators consist of Nyctophilia, Vyrtriv and Caxelon. 

Days after days, TTU relentless strive to slain titans after titans. Until one day….
TTU encountered an extremely tough Titan Lord called Enigma. The Titan Lord had broken down every single member from TTU. Leaving BrainStormX no choice, he sacrificed the “Storm” in him to seal the very titan into a flux dimensional called *Plane of Conundrum*. 

Meanwhile somewhere deep in the Tap Titan Universe shadow realm, a dark force dissolute rising up.
Without the Storm, BrainX is just a soulless shell. However, it is still not too late to save BrainstormX from the Plane of Conundrum. 

SilicalNZ was able to sense the dark force clearly. Without Grandmaster lead, he need to take up the role to make quick decision for the clan. Saving Grandmaster from the Plane of Conundrum and defend the world from Dark Forces.
SilicalNZ knew travelling through the void across to the Plane of Conundrum will take a huge toll on any Sword Masters. He knew he had to do it but he was not alone.

Time is precious. Every second endangered both the fate of their Grandmaster and the world. Without further hesitation, SilicalNZ made an implausible verdict. He carefully chosen 3 most heroics of all. All 3 of them were Master Ranked, highly trained and skilled. Jazzy, UnluckyGecko and Burly followed bravely. 

Bidding farewell, SilicalNZ can only entrust and leave TTU world to the hands of Caxelon, Nyctophilia and Vyrtriv.

The Chosen Moderators stood conceitedly on a highland watching over the darken sky spreading rapidly beyond the land of Shadow Realm. Those were Titans, filling up the sky, land and sea. Thousands upon thousands. They feared the worst had yet to come. They either stop the spread now or never. 

Each Moderator brought along a dozen of TTU clan members ranked Master to mere recruits. Caxelon team equipped with Blue Wind and Butterfly Effect flew towards the enemies. Nyctophilia team equipped with Magnetic Power and Leaf Shield ran towards the dark realm. Lastly Vyrtriv team equipped with Whirlpool and Smells Fishy swam across the ocean. 

It was never a good idea to spread thin TTU forces but neither do they have the luxury of choice. 

PLANE OF CONUNDRUM

Stepping out from the dimensional portal had worn all 4 of them. None was build or train to endure this kind of tormented actions. 

The world they saw was dark and surreal. The landscape, terrain and peculiar structures defy the law of physics and form a world of neverending mazes. 

This is not a prison seal created by BrainStormX to seal Enigma. 

This is Enigma’s world. 
Walking through the gigantic maze is not going to help. They have to seek for the evil source as soon as possible. 

The ground tremors vastly. Floor cracked opens around them. Suddenly all four of them is surrounded by dozen of Titan Lords climbed from the split. 

Jazzy stood forward bravely. 

‘Leave this to me. You guys go on ahead,’ Jazzy uttered as she drawn her Legendary Poisonous Spellblade.  
With Jazzy 100% hit rate, she performed her flawless moves by slashing every Titan Lords standing before her without any miss. 12 out of 16 were slain immediately while the rest crimpled. TTU can always count on her unmatched supremacy. She was not ranked No. 1 Master without reason. Before she realized, a dozen more climbed up and she knew she would not be able to join back the group anytime soon.  

Further down in the outlandish maze, SilicalNZ sensed the strong evil aura from the opposite end. Going through the maze will indefinitely consume an expanse amount of time and energy with all the revolting titans lurking at every corner of the maze. Those Titans lungful to slay every Sword Masters they ever encountered. Each Titan stronger than another as the group endeavored deeper. Nevertheless, it posed no difficulty to both UnluckyGecko and Burly even in their present weakened state. Both of them slain every single Titan without having SilicalNZ to move a single muscle. Reserving his energy was their main priority. 

Back on the Tap Titan Universe, battle after battle raged between TTU and massive number of titans gushing through non-stop. 

Nyctophilia leading the ground forces slain every single Titans rapidly. Master Konen was on the right side and Master Sazed was on the left. It was unbelievable that only 3 of them was more than adequate to defend the ground front line. Sporadically 1 or 2 Titans passed them, but was quickly eliminated by the other Knights and Recruits guarding firmly behind them. 

Sky above, Caxelon escorted by a few strong clanmates with him. Among them was Master Nightingale, Master Ragnarok and an outstanding Recruit MellowArcher whom labelled as prevailing as any Master Ranked. Caxelon and three of them sent forth dozens of “Make It Rain” to held the titans crusade and allow other clanmates to slain them effectively. 

In the vast Ocean, Vyrtriv accompanied by Master Obi Juan and Master Nekro, forming whirlpool after whirlpool to snare the titans altogether. Where other clanmates took this opportunity to slain the titans. From the back, Master Ranked Martil gathered his strength from time to time which he unleashed and exterminated all the gathered titans with a single strike using his Legendary Knightfall Sword. It never fails to amazed the entire clan every time he strikes. 
The entire TTU clan was tiring themselves with the titans. Little do they know, they were only touching the surface of it. There is a dark scheme plotting somewhere deep in the Dark Realm which would change the very world of Tap Titan Universe.

CHAPTER - LOADING SCREEN 1

A week had passed. Jazzy had managed to stopped all the Titan Lords ambuscade and joined back SilicalNZ. To her consternation, she saw Burly was injured and fortunately UnluckyGecko was unharmed. SilicalNZ is still preserving his strength to face his upcoming adversary.

‘It’s ok Burly, we will handle from here onwards,’ said Jazzy relieving the team. 

Tragedy. 

A clan mate was gone. He did his best to held up the ground forces with all his might. Alas, a Swamp King Titan penetrated Sazed heart, called to his grave. Before Sazed took his last breath, he lacerated the Titan into pieces.

Nyctophilia and Konen was frozen for a split moment. Sazed had been with TTU for almost 8 weeks. He gained Knight position on the 3rd week while Master position on the 5th week. Everyone felt deeply sympathy but grieving was not an option. The battle is far from over. Nyctophilia channeled his rage to fuel his energy aura increasing his critical strike to 50%. 

The battle had been disadvantage to TTU since the beginning. TTU had suffered casualties. 

In the midst of the battles, 2 promising members stood out from the crowd. mcro12 and iKizuto rushed to the front assisting Nyctophilia. Both displayed potential Master Rank power defeating the Titans along Konen.
While Ragnarok and MellowArcher suffered great injuries against the flying Titans, they retreated for recuperation. 

Master Ranked Junior returned after a week of scouting on enemy territories. He brought grave news as he flew to Caxelon. There was a mole. TTU had been infiltrated. It was all part of a grave plot planned by the Sovereign of the Titan Lords. BrainStormX was deceived and faltered right into the deception and leading to current state.

After informed Caxelon, Junior flew towards Nyctophilia. However, he failed to notice a Hawk Hunter titan was following behind and prepared to launch a pre-emptive attack. Konen saw and dashed immediately towards Junior and saved him but at the cost of his own life. Junior immediately reacted and eliminated the titan. Junior swore that he will avenge for those who sacrificed valiantly for TTU. 

Konen, with 12 weeks records in TTU, was ranked Master on his first week itself. His deeds will forever be in the heart of TTU clan.

What Junior alleged was unbelievable. Even as Junior spoke to others, he himself could not comprehend the datum. TTU was betrayed not only by their own kind but someone reputable. Someone even BrainStormX respect. It was none other than hdotfi. One of TTU earlier respectable GrandMaster who elevated TTU. His legacy was incontrovertible. Back then BrainStormX was only an advisor named SpadeX who supported hdotfi. Together they shaped the very TTU today. 
 
‘But why is hdotfi doing this?’
‘Was he portending to do it due to other reason?’
‘Or did he really fall into darkness?’

The questions puzzled everyone.

Days and nights, Jazzy forged the path in the maze leading them forward. Injuries and fatigued took over UnluckyGecko and Burly. Leaving them behind for recovery, Jazzy and SilicalNZ continued meandered and arrived at a strange oval and tall sculpture which formed an entrance of a passage way. This is clearly a trap. However, this is the only way in. And they walked in.  

BrainStormX awaken from a dark chamber with dozens of giant tubes made of glass standing from the floor to the soffit ceiling. Each tube housed a Titan sleeping soundly. 

‘Welcome to my chamber,’ a deep voice broke the silence of the cavity as a hood figurine stepped out from a dark corner. 

‘Who are you,’ asked BrainStormX curiously. ‘And where am I?’

CHAPTER  - LOADING SCREEN 2 

Martil had incoherently unleashing his power in the middle of the ocean outweighing the damage against any single TTU members on each burst of damage. While Obi Juan exhausted, Vyrtriv and Nekro continued generating whirlpool. Out of the sudden, a gigantic Titan Lord appear in the middle of Whirlpool and counter Martil strike. In abruptly, Junior rushed to the front and defended Martil. His body was radiating with dynamism in a prevailing atmosphere. Junior had finally reached 4k MS and turned out that he was the Storm which BrainX sacrificed to seal Enigma.

The Titans had finally thinned out. Caxelon and Nightingale managed to held the sky battle field with the help of one newly joined Recruit. ILC with less than one week with TTU but demonstrated strength of any Master Ranked member. Only surpassed by Jazzy and Martil. This was also due to his 100% accuracy in each of his attack. No doubt his journey with TTU will gained significant standing in the near future. 

TTU had withstand and protected the world against 600 Clan Quests. It means they had slain a total of 600 Titan Lords. This moment marked another great success and step for everyone as it was also virtuously based on the contribution of every single members. No doubt the journey was lengthy and dreary. Many had sacrificed and/or left TTU for good. Nevertheless, there were continually new warriors who join the cause. Only those who were robust and devoted in heart, mind and soul will continue to stay strong and unswerving. 

Back on the land, iKizuto had performed well and promoted to Master. Nyctophilia and iKizuto endured and slain the remaining Titans. Among the ashes of battle, a huge Titan Lord appeared and forced both of them to retreat. Until Master Shirx appeared from behind and hold the ground together and to destroy the Titan Lord pieces by pieces. Victory belongs to TTU but at a huge cost and unrestrained perseverance.

The passageway led to an underground labyrinth. Housed countless chambers for Titan Lords. It takes a full clan to take down each Titan Lord. Jazzy unleashed her “Godmode” aura. Only those who possess constant 100% attendance rate would attained such aura. With her dominant métier, Jazzy single handedly eliminated each Titan Lords which even impressed SilicalNZ. 

‘Who am I?’ asked hdotfi as he removed his hood. ‘You know better who I am.’

‘That is not possible,’ said BrainStormX unbelievably. ‘I saw you dead with my own eyes.’

‘Well. Indeed. I merely reborn again.’

‘You were our GM. You trained us. You led us. You sacrificed your life and protected TTU. We aim to vanquish all the evil from this imperfect world.’

hdotfi released his aura and lighted up the whole chamber. 

‘You see. I was naïve and blind like the rest of you. The world isn’t perfect to begin with. When I was inert, my eyes opened for the first time. I saw what could have happen. I knew I was destined to carry out god’s duty to purify this tainted world. And with my new-found power, I can do it.’

‘I am not going to let that happened,’ interrupted BrainStormX viciously.

CHAPTER - LOADING SCREEN 3 

The sea had finally calmed down when Storm took out the last of the titans.

‘We done it guys,’ said Vyrtriv. ‘We stopped the catastrophe.’

‘No, it’s not over yet,’ interrupted Storm anxiously. ‘This is just the beginning. BrainX is in trouble. I can feel it.’

‘At least we had prevented the dark forces invading our world. And now we can only trust SilicalNZ and Jazzy to save our GM,’ responded Vyrtriv.

After clearing the sky, Caxelon set up a special task force led by ILC to voyage into the Dark Realm. The news brought back by Storm previously was not sufficient to plan their next move. Only way to find out was through the Dark Realm. A realm that non-mortal would ever emanated out alive. Without delay, ILC enlisted Knight Gremel and a promising new recruit dragos on this deadly mission. 

ILC, Gremel and dragos flew to where Nyctophilia was. They requested Nyctophilia to join forces with them as they knew the upcoming battles would be impossible. Nyctophilia trusted ikizuto and Shirx to protect the ground forces. 

Jazzy, ILC and Nyctophilia formed the pillars of TTU. Any 2 of them join forces could overcome any impediments. 

Finally Jazzy and SilicalNZ found the exit to the labyrinth. Jazzy stepped forward to the exit and suddenly a wall closed behind her trapping SilicalNZ in the labyrinth. White gases released and filled the labyrinth. SilicalNZ soon vanished in the smoke.  Jazzy tried to find a way to open the access but unsuccessful. 

‘Your actions are futile,’ said Enigma. Jazzy quickly face her noxious foe in an openly vast underground cave with mesmerizing precious rock protuberant ubiquitously. ‘I was not expecting anyone to even reach here. But you prove me wrong. You made it here. And only you.’ 



CHAPTER - LOADING SCREEN 4

‘Take a look,’ said hdotfi as he pointed at the abstractedly formed portal displayed at the wall. ‘Your rescuers who intend to save you. One trapped in the labyrinth and another facing your nightmare. Do not worry as you will join them on the other side of the world soon.’

BrainStormX scowled at to the person he lost trust with and exasperated in silence.  

‘Meanwhile I will leave my new toys to entertain with you,’ smirked hdotfi as he left the chamber activating the experimental Titan Lords. Each of the Titan Lords awakened from its unfathomable torpor as the liquid discharged out from the giant tube.

BrainStormX lost all his power. He definitely wouldn’t be able to deal even a single normal titan. He had to act quick before matter turn abhorrent. 

Suddenly the ceiling cave exploded. Two powerful and spirited neophytes broke in from above and entered the chamber as the giant tubes containing the Titan Lords splintered. Both recruited less than a week but possessed promising Master Rank power. valoutozor1er and laumius deflected the Titan Lords looming their GM.

‘About damn time,’ uttered BrainStormX as he knew he could trust his clan.

Both of them quickly grabbed BrainStormX and exit through the hole they came in before any of the Titan Lords could even react. 

The experimental Titan Lords had finally released. Developed utilizing Enigma’s genetic factor. TTU would definitely face a great challenged against the varnished Titan Lords. The question how Enigma came remained clandestine.

The first wave came from the sea below. Unfortunately, Vyrtriv was a little worn out due to the previous sea battle. However, he had both Storm and Martil to support him. 

It had been days, dragos and Nyctophilia forged the Titan Lands towards the depth of Dark Realm followed by Gremel and IFC from behind. 

Loud thundered trembled across from where they came. 

‘That must be Martil enraged form,’ said Nyctophilia as he recognized immediately on the aura vibrated through the atmosphere even at such distance away.

‘That is impossible,’ interrupted dragos. ‘No such mortal could have unleashed this amount of sheer power.’

‘Not to Martil,’ smiled Nyctophilia. ‘He was not called the beast of TTU for no reason. Nevertheless, for him to released such power could only means they are facing really tough opponents now.’ 

‘We are definitely nowhere near him,’ said Gremel. 

‘Indeed, but what makes TTU strong is the bond between all of us,’ said Nyctophilia.

‘I will never make him my enemy,’ said ILC as they all laughed.

Jazzy fought with Enigma days and nights without respite. Even with her Godmode aura, she faced an extremely tough battle. She was exhausted and Enigma had not break a sweat. 

‘I had to admit you indeed pack a greater challenged than any of your clan members but you will never defeat me alone,’ chuckled Enigma as Jazzy fell on the ground to catch her breath. ‘Why don’t I let you rest to regain your energy so we could continue our little battle.’ 

‘You are wrong,’ responded Jazzy confidently. ‘I will never be alone.’

The cave behind where she came out from exploded. From the ashes of the smoke, stood 3 figurines. 
 
‘Jazzy is right,’ bellowed Burly ferociously. ‘She will never be alone.’ 

Burly walked out from the shadow along with Vice GM - SilicalNZ and Knight - Falcon. 

‘It feels good to be back. I had recovered. Thanks to Falcon. He had been following us from behind all along and protected me when I was recuperating.’ 

‘Oh, that’s four of you now. Things will get a little more interesting from now on,’ smiled Enigma. 

CHAPTER - LOADING SCREEN 5

BrainStormX barely escaped the cave. Both valoutozor1er and laumius were exhausted.   

‘I had a great discovery while I was being held captive,’ alleged BrainStormX. ‘I need to inform everyone about the Erevos world. Something immense is going to occur between our world and Erevos. 

The new generation of Titan Lords are much stronger, faster and intelligent. Storm suffered perilous injury while Vyrtriv and Martil fought courageously on the front line. Even with Martil supermassive strength, they managed to take down 1 Titan Lord against a dozen. 

dragos, Nyctophilia, ILC and Gremel came to chasm stretched out as far as eyes could perceived. 

‘This is it,’ said Nyctophilia chronically. ‘The entrance to the enemy lair.’ 

Without further delay, all of them jump into the chasm. Gremel injured badly due to the fall and stayed back for recovery. 

Enigma unleashed a concentrated electrified ball towards SilicalNZ. Before it hit SilicalNZ, Burly rushed to the front and took a direct hit while SilicalNZ received moderate damage. 

Jazzy was raged and triggered her Godmode aura again to battle against Enigma with newly ranked Master Falcon. 

BrainStormX and team had finally meet with Master Ranked Tom outside.

‘Alright guys, you had done well,’ said Tom to valoutozor1er and laumius. ‘You may fall back and recover now. I will take lead from here onwards. Come Grandmaster, we don’t have much time. They are just ahead battling against Enigma. We need your wisdom and guidance.’

‘How did you guys managed to find me?’ asked BrainStormX.

‘We had been tracking your energy since you had gone,’ replied Tom. ‘SilicalNZ knew this was a trapped. His team was meant for a diversion and he sent us as a rescuing team instead.’ 

‘I had a lot to share but first I need my strength back,’ said BrainStormX.

‘I had arranged for it,’ replied Tom.
